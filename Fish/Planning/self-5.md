## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 5

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin placements for setups 
<https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/texline/tree/9d9b1b22daffac20c042c42c820b8dc32be25c59/Fish/Common/src/model/strategy/IStrategy.java#L12-L21>

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns
<https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/texline/tree/9d9b1b22daffac20c042c42c820b8dc32be25c59/Fish/Common/src/model/strategy/IStrategy.java#L23-L32>


- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy 
    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/texline/tree/9d9b1b22daffac20c042c42c820b8dc32be25c59/Fish/Common/test/model/StrategyTest.java#L126-L174>
- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths
  <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/texline/tree/9d9b1b22daffac20c042c42c820b8dc32be25c59/Fish/Common/test/model/StrategyTest.java#L176-L335>

  
- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:
  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`
  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules 
  
  I believe this is meant to say xtree instead of xtest based on Matthias's response on Piazza.
  We didn't add any functionality to our game-tree.java to create the xtree test harness.

**Please use GitHub perma-links to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.**
