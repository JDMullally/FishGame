# B - Command Line

xyes is a shell-executable command-line program that echos the command line arguments to standard
output. The purpose is to to get to know our partners with a tiny on-line assignment and to learn
to live up very rudimentary specifications.

### Example

```
$  ./xyes [-limit] [arg1 arg2 ...argN]
```

Which turns all command line arguments into a string and concatenates those strings, separated by 
a single ASCII blank space. The program displays this final string an infinite number of times to
STDOUT, or 20 times if the first command line argument is "â€“limit". If there are no command line 
arguments to form the output string, the program uses "hello world" instead.

### Testing

Go to the `B/Other` directory and run:

```
$  ./test.sh
```
