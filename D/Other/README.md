# D - GUI

xgui a program that pops up a window and draws a hexagon into the window.
The size of the hexagon (in pixels) is specified as the sole command-line argument.

### Example

```
$  ./xyes positive-integer
```

The program pops up a window and draws the hexagon of the appropriate size into the window.
It closes the window and shuts down when a "user" clicks inside the hexagon.
